# Important: Complete Countries Data

The file `backend/src/utils/countriesData.js` currently contains only 2 sample countries (Montenegro and Morocco).

**You need to paste the full country data array that you provided in your message into this file.**

The file should export an array with all 195 countries in this format:

```javascript
export const countriesData = [
  // Paste all your country data here
  // Starting from Montenegro through Zimbabwe
];
```

After completing this file, run the seed script:
```bash
node backend/src/utils/seed_countries.js
```

This will populate all countries into your database.
